# Meeting calendar

It is a study project. In it I will recycle FrontEnd knowledge, using ReactJs to help me in this process of creating dynamic screens.

The project consists of the idea of having a list of the days of the week, and with that being able to schedule events on those days.

----

## To-do

- [ ] The events will be recorded in the 'storage' of the client's browser
 open form when clicking on the specific day, the date will already be set according to the day that was chosen.

- [ ] The events will be recorded in the 'storage' of the client's browser

- [ ] functionality to change themes (which have already been created)

- [ ] event alert

-----

## Scripts for run this project

You can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Obs.: During the evolution of the project, this document also tends to evolve!
